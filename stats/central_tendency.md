## Mean
The *mean* of a list of numbers is what people usually mean when they say the "average" of those numbers. It is computed by adding up all of the numbers and dividing by the length of the list.

For example:

![the mean of 2, 5, 3, and 1 is 2 + 5 + 3 + 1, all divided by 4, which is 2.75](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?mean(2,5,3,1)=\frac{(2+5+3+1)}{4}=2.75)
