# Daily Individual Assignment 0:  Entering the classroom

## Assignment goal

Welcome to the first *Reflection* assignment for your Fall 2020 Numbers course.  *Reflection* assignments ask you to write **informal** answers to the questions given in the assignment.  Sometimes you will do a reading prior to answering the questions, sometimes a reading will not be required.  When we say the writing in a *Reflection* assignment is **informal**, we mean that the assignment will not be graded for things like correct grammar or precise organization. Instead we will be looking for evidence that you have thought through the questions being asked.  In short, we will read for content rather than format.

This *Reflection* assignment has two goals. The first goal is to remind ourselves that a college classroom brings together a wonderful mix of all sorts of different people, including people from backgrounds that we are not familiar with. Keeping this fact in mind will be important as we develop the ground rules for classroom discussions. The second goal is to raise the idea that technology doesn't exist independent of people. This is a first glance at the entire focus of the *Measuring Up* sections of Numbers, namely the intersection of data, computing, and people.
