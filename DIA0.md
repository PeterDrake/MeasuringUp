# Daily Individual Assignment 0:  Entering the classroom

Welcome to the first *Reflection* assignment for you Fall 2020 Numbers course.  *Reflection* assignments ask you to write informal answers to the questions given in the assignment.  Sometimes you will do a reading prior to answering the questions, sometimes a reading will not be required.  When we say the writing in a *Reflection* assignment is informal, we mean that the assignment will not be graded for things like correct grammar or precise organization. Instead we will be looking for evidence that you have thought through the questions being asked.  In short, we will read for content rather than format.
