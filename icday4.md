# Instructions for this repl:  Exploring Class Data Part 2

## Assignment goal: Explore a data set using descriptive statistics and graphical displays of data
 
 The data from our class survey is already loaded into this project.  In the scripting window (the one where we write code) you'll see a bunch of commands commented out.  Once we move into breakout groups please do the following with your team members: cut, paste, uncomment, and modify these commands as you explore our survey data.  Share your repl screens so that others can see what your are doing.  Help each other so that by the end of class everyone on your team is doing well at making graphs (specifically bar plots, histograms, and scatterplots) in Python. 
 
 Please write/paste interesting graphs and other descriptions of the data in this shared Google Doc. Next to what you add, please write the names of your team members.
