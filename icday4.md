# Instructions for this repl:  Exploring Class Data Part 2

## Assignment goal: Explore a data set using descriptive statistics and graphical displays of data
 
 The data from our class survey is already loaded into this project.  In the scripting window (the one where we write code) you'll see a bunch of commands commented out.  Please cut, paste, uncomment, and modify these commands as you explore our survey data.  
 
 Please write/paste interesting graphs and other descriptions of the data in this shared Google Doc.
